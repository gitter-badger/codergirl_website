 Absolute Beginners: The Basics
        Don't spend too long on these, but a fun way to learn the basics.
        Scratch
        Easy
        Scratch is a great place to start if you're a total beginner. Scratch was
            designed for kids to learn programming, but that doesn't mean it's just
            a toy. It uses all the same programming concepts as any text-based language
            - it is real programming. If you want a course with assignments and specific
            goals, you can check on EdX.org for a free class on Scratch or you can
            learn on your own through the Scratch website.

        Quick Guided Tour - Code with Anna and Elsa
        Very Easy
        The Hour of Code http://hourofcode.com/us
            program was created to encourage kids and adults to spend an hour (or
            a bit more) exploring programming. This is similar to Scratch (see previous)
            but with more guidance and direction, and more tutorials. If you've never
            programmed before, this is a fun place to start.

            that uses the graphics side of Javascript (a programming language) to
            introduce you to programming, through video training and lots of hands-on
            practice. This course is a good choice if you are interested in graphics
            and animation, or if you want a visual approach to programming with carefully
            guided practice problems. They also have classes on HTML/CSS (for web
            design) and SQL (for databases).

            Getting In-Depth: Medium Difficulty

            Beginner Professional Java
            Easy
            This Java course focuses on clear explanations for absolute beginners,
                lots of hands-on practice, vocabulary and talking about code, group
                collaboration, and the software planning process. It teaches technical
                study skills alongside the material, so you are more prepared when
                you shift to other programming studies. Self-evaluation checklists
                and quizzes help you check your progress. Since there are no grades,
                collaboration is encouraged and valuable. This is a great course
                to take before diving into CS50x.

                Diving In: Difficult Courses
                Harvard CS50x
                Hard
                Harvard's CS50x class focuses on using programming for problem solving.
                    The assignments are the real meat of the course. This course
                    assumes you have very strong study skills, will put together
                    your own notes and vocabulary review, and have mentors to lean
                    on when you get stuck. It also assumes you have strong google
                    search skills although it doesn't give you all the names you
                    need to search for things. This is for technically experienced
                    independent learners with a strong community to learn within.
                    There are CS50x mentors at the CoderGirl meetings.

                Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
                Hard
                This is the first of a two-course sequence from MIT that aims to
                    expose people to computer science to think computationally and
                    tackle problems. This course uses the programming language Python
                    as its basis for learning, which some people may find easier
                    than the C language used in CS50x.
