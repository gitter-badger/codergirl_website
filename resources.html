		<h1>Diving In: Difficult Courses</h1>
		<h2>Harvard CS50x</h2>
		<p>Level: Hard &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Time Demand: Heavy</p>
		<p>Website: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">  https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x </a></p>
		<p>Harvard's CS50x class focuses on using programming for problem solving. The assignments
		are the real meat of the course. This course assumes you have very strong study skills, will
		put together your own notes and vocabulary review, and have mentors to lean on when you
		get stuck. It also assumes you have strong google search skills although it doesn't give you
		all the names you need to search for things. This is for technically experienced independent
		learners with a strong community to learn within. There are CS50x mentors at the CoderGirl meetings.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</h2>
		<p>Level: Hard  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Time Demand: Heavy</p>
		<p>Website:<a href=" https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0">  https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0</a></p>
		<p>This is the first of a two-course sequence from MIT that aims to expose people to computer
		science to think computationally and tackle problems. This course uses the programming
		language Python as its basis for learning, which some people may find easier than the C
		language used in CS50x.</p>

		<h1>After CS50 - Now What?</h1>
		<p>"I completed CS50 last year. But I feel like I need to learn more before I go
		into a job. What should I do?"
		First off, congratulations! CS50 is pretty demanding. Talk with the various mentors. We're considering setting up some project teams to give intermediate developers more experience. This is adhoc, so we need to know who's available and interested and what their time availability is, to sort out plans.	If you can't participate in team projects, but you want to focus towards career possibilities,	then you need to find a way to start learning the basics of these topics. The most important part is to work on concepts and vocabulary on everything, and getting hands-on with SQL.
		<ul>
			<li> Relational databases and SQL
			<li> Software requirements planning
			<li> Software development life cycle
			<li>Test cases, quality assurance techniques, and unit testing
			<li>Concepts of test-driven development
			<li>Agile and scrum software project management methodologies
			<li>Refactoring and design patterns
		</ul>
		<p>You should also focus on putting together some portfolio projects to show off what you can do and continue building your skills. Mentors may be able to help you with code reviews, as well.</p>
		<p>If you're interested, check out LaunchCodeTV for some awesome mini-lectures made by some former mentors: <a href="http://tv.launchcode.us/">  http://tv.launchcode.us/</a></p>
		<p>You can also check out a Java CS50x class, run by Mike Menne (former LaunchCode
		mentor), to introduce CS50x graduates to Java:</p>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/MoMenne/launchcode-java-class">  https://github.com/MoMenne/launchcode-java-class</a></p>
		<p>If you can help out as a mentor, you will also find that deepens your understanding of
		programming and is a fun way to stay involved.</p>

		to get bootstrap go to www.getboostrap.com to download

		Copy those folders to your project. The css folder has 6 files, 3 with theme 3 without.  The
		theme refers to the 2.0 version the without to the 3.0  I generally use the without.  The min
		is minimized for faster download.  Usually use that.

		You may want to move the contents of the js folder into the scripts folder that has the jquery.

		if want to use a CDN instead of downloading

		The folks over at MaxCDN graciously provide CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript.
		Just use these Bootstrap CDN links.
