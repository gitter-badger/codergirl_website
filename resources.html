		are the real meat of the course. This course assumes you have very strong study skills, will
		put together your own notes and vocabulary review, and have mentors to lean on when you
		get stuck. It also assumes you have strong google search skills although it doesn't give you
		all the names you need to search for things. This is for technically experienced independent
		learners with a strong community to learn within. There are CS50x mentors at the CoderGirl meetings.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</h2>
		<p>Level: Hard  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Time Demand: Heavy</p>
		<p>Website:<a href=" https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0">  https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0</a></p>

		science to think computationally and tackle problems. This course uses the programming
		language Python as its basis for learning, which some people may find easier than the C
		language used in CS50x.</p>

		<h1>After CS50 - Now What?</h1>
		<p>"I completed CS50 last year. But I feel like I need to learn more before I go
		into a job. What should I do?"
		First off, congratulations! CS50 is pretty demanding. Talk with the various mentors. We're considering setting up some project teams to give intermediate developers more experience. This is adhoc, so we need to know who's available and interested and what their time availability is, to sort out plans.	If you can't participate in team projects, but you want to focus towards career possibilities,	then you need to find a way to start learning the basics of these topics. The most important part is to work on concepts and vocabulary on everything, and getting hands-on with SQL.
		<ul>
			<li> Relational databases and SQL
			<li> Software requirements planning
			<li> Software development life cycle
			<li>Test cases, quality assurance techniques, and unit testing
			<li>Concepts of test-driven development
			<li>Agile and scrum software project management methodologies
			<li>Refactoring and design patterns
		</ul>
		<p>You should also focus on putting together some portfolio projects to show off what you can do and continue building your skills. Mentors may be able to help you with code reviews, as well.</p>
		<p>If you're interested, check out LaunchCodeTV for some awesome mini-lectures made by some former mentors: <a href="http://tv.launchcode.us/">  http://tv.launchcode.us/</a></p>
		<p>You can also check out a Java CS50x class, run by Mike Menne (former LaunchCode
		mentor), to introduce CS50x graduates to Java:</p>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/MoMenne/launchcode-java-class">  https://github.com/MoMenne/launchcode-java-class</a></p>
		<p>If you can help out as a mentor, you will also find that deepens your understanding of
		programming and is a fun way to stay involved.</p>
