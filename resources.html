        <h2>Scratch</h2>
        <h3>Easy</h3>
        <p>Scratch is a great place to start if you're a total beginner. Scratch was
            designed for kids to learn programming, but that doesn't mean it's just
            a toy. It uses all the same programming concepts as any text-based language
            - it is real programming. If you want a course with assignments and specific
            goals, you can check on EdX.org for a free class on Scratch or you can
            learn on your own through the Scratch website.</p>

        <p>The Hour of Code <a href="http://hourofcode.com/us"> http://hourofcode.com/us</a>
            program was created to encourage kids and adults to spend an hour (or
            a bit more) exploring programming. This is similar to Scratch (see previous)
            but with more guidance and direction, and more tutorials. If you've never
            programmed before, this is a fun place to start.</p>

        <p>Khan Academy is an online learning website that offers classes and training
            in many subjects, including computer programming. They have one track
            that uses the graphics side of Javascript (a programming language) to

            practice. This course is a good choice if you are interested in graphics
            and animation, or if you want a visual approach to programming with carefully
            guided practice problems. They also have classes on HTML/CSS (for web
            design) and SQL (for databases). </p>

            <h2>Beginner Professional Java</h2>
            <h3>Easy</h3>
            <p>This Java course focuses on clear explanations for absolute beginners,
                lots of hands-on practice, vocabulary and talking about code, group
                collaboration, and the software planning process. It teaches technical
                study skills alongside the material, so you are more prepared when
                you shift to other programming studies. Self-evaluation checklists
                and quizzes help you check your progress. Since there are no grades,
                collaboration is encouraged and valuable. This is a great course
                to take before diving into CS50x.</p>

                    on when you get stuck. It also assumes you have strong google
                    search skills although it doesn't give you all the names you
                    need to search for things. This is for technically experienced
                    independent learners with a strong community to learn within.

                <p>This is the first of a two-course sequence from MIT that aims to
                    expose people to computer science to think computationally and
                    tackle problems. This course uses the programming language Python
                    as its basis for learning, which some people may find easier
                    than the C language used in CS50x.</p>
