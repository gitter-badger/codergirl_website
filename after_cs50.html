        <h2>"I completed CS50 last year. But I feel like I need to learn more before I go into a job. What should I do?" </h2>

        <p>First off, congratulations! CS50 is pretty demanding. Talk with the various
            mentors. We're considering setting up some project teams to give intermediate
            developers more experience. This is adhoc, so we need to know who's available
            and interested and what their time availability is, to sort out plans.</p>
        <p>If you can't participate in team projects, but you want to focus towards
            career possibilities, then you need to find a way to start learning the
            basics of these topics. The most important part is to work on concepts
            and vocabulary on everything, and getting hands-on with SQL.
            <ul>
                <li> Relational databases and SQL
                <li> Software requirements planning
                <li> Software development life cycle
                <li> Test cases, quality assurance techniques, and unit testing
                <li> Concepts of test-driven development
                <li> Agile and scrum software project management methodologies
                <li>Refactoring and design patterns

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You should also focus on putting together some portfolio projects to show
            off what you can do and continue building your skills. Mentors may be
            able to help you with code reviews, as well.</p>
        <p>If you can help out as a mentor, you will also find that deepens your understanding
            of programming and is a fun way to stay involved.</p>
