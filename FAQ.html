	<h3>Q: What is CoderGirl?</h3>
		<p>A free all-womanâ€™s coding group. It is a safe space for women of any age, background, and skill level.</p>
		<p> Getting started as a woman in a male-dominated field can make it especially difficult for aspiring female coders to break into the programming workforce. Hence, CoderGirl.</p>
		<p>CoderGirl is building a network of support for aspiring female coders. Participants, ranging from beginners to long-time programmers, hone their skills alongside fellow aspiring developers and female mentors from companies like Boeing, MasterCard, and Enterprise etc.</p>

	<h3>Q: What is a typical CoderGirl meet up like?</h3>
		<p>After weekly announcements, you may break into a mini-group according to your interests. Currently, we have mini-groups for Java, Web Development, SQL, and Harvard 50x problems sets. You can also just hang-out and work on your own project or collaborate with others. Each meet-up will have several experienced Mentors available to ask for guidance. Furthermore, every other week will feature a guest speaker to discuss various topics such as careers, skill-building, and self-care as it relates to coding.</p></div>

	<h3>Q: When and where does CoderGirl meet?</h3>
		<p>ADDRESS</p>
		<p>Parking is free. Also, the Central West End metrolink station is a short walkable distance. If you can't make it every week or stay the entire meet-up time, join us whenever you can.</p><br></div>

	<div class="fourth">
		<h3>Q: My school-aged daughter is interested in coding. Can I bring her?</h3>
		<p>Absolutely! It's well known that girls can become discouraged from pursing STEM fields like computer science. CoderGirl offers a supportive environment where she can feel comfortable exploring and learning code. </p></div>
